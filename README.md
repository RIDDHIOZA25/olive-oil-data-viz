Olive Orbit: Global Olive Oil Data Analysis

Our project explores global olive oil production, consumption, imports, and trade flows from 2018/19 to 2023/24. Using data from the International Olive Council, we analyze trends, patterns, and market dynamics to provide insights into the olive oil industry's global footprint. Through visualizations and exploratory analysis, we aim to uncover key findings and support decision-making for stakeholders in the industry.
